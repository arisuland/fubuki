## Features

- :octocat: **Open Source and Free** — Arisu is 100% free and open source, so you can host your own instance if you please!
- ✨ **Monorepos** — Create multiple subprojects into a single repository without having to maintain multiple repositories.
- ⚡ **Robust** — Arisu makes your workflow way easier and manageable without any high latency.

...and much more!

## Hey... this is a different repository?

Yea, I decided to create a new repository for Arisu. The old [repository](https://github.com/arisuland/Arisu) is... weird as of the commit history and the turn for the project, so I decided to create a new one.

## Modules

Arisu is split into different packages, each of which is a seperate folder in this repository.

- [**github-bot**](./github-bot) — A GitHub bot that automatically syncs your translations with GitHub.
- [**typings**](./typings) — A package that provides typings for Arisu's JavaScript SDKs.
- [**web**](./web) — Web application that runs [arisu.land](https://arisu.land)

There are other projects within the Arisu ecosystem, but they are split into different repositories under the **arisuland** organization.

If the projects return a **`404`** status code, it means that the project is not yet ready for public use.

## Self-hosting

Before we get started, I recommend learn how to run Node.js projects before you install Arisu. The Arisu Team **will** not help you if you don't understand how to run a Node.js project. :)

> :warning: **Arisu is not ready for production yet! So be cautious before running (un)stable releases.**
