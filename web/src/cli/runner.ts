/**
 * Represents the CLI runner for executing Fubuki commands. Read more about
 * what to do with the fubuki [CLI usage](https://docs.arisu.land/fubuki/cli).
 *
 * ### Commands
 * There is multiple commands to administrate Fubuki. The available ones are:
 * - `fubuki [-c ...]` - Bootstraps and runs the Fubuki server. If `cluster.enabled`
 *   is set to **true**, Fubuki will perform a cluster / node election to elect which one
 *   can manage multiple Fubuki nodes.
 *
 * - `fubuki ping [-c ...]` - If `cluster.enabled` is set to **true**, Fubuki will run
 *   a ping check on all nodes, otherwise, it'll just ping the current Next.js instance.
 *
 * - `fubuki validate [config file] [-e]` - Validates a Fubuki [configuration file](https://docs.arisu.land/fubuki/self-hosting#configuration)
 *   or the system's environment variables to check if it's valid or not.
